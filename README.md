# Chang2019_from_mouse2018
The suite for the REBP 2018 paper with first author EG Huang runs for y_0 = 0.0275 and may run for larger values.
RKS will try to recreate a running copy of Chang2019_plus code from the suite. The latest functional version will be kept here
The latest modifications will be kept in RKS' sandbox project of the same name on his home PC
